# ASP.NET Core Protected Browser API in Blazor

This repository contains the source code demonstrating the ASP.NET Core Protected Browser API in a Blazor Server application (.NET 8) with component prerendering enabled.

Unfortunately, I couldn't make it work. The `OnAfterRenderAsync` lifecycle method is never called.

You can find a working demo app (with component prerendering disabled) here: https://github.com/claudiobernasconi/ProtectedBrowserStorage
